- Use the most specific code: (1|2|3|4)(A–E|X)?(a–e|x)?  e.g., (1)(A)(c), (3)(B)(d), (2)(C).
- Keep item EXACTLY as it appears in the input (surface form). Add other seen surface forms to aliases.
- Be minimal and factual. Do not include anything not present in the input.
- Note that first, second, and third category number must be enclosed by small brackets respectively, like "(3)(A)(b)".
